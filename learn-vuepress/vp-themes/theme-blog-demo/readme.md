NOTE: This `theme-blog` does not inherit from `theme-default`!

We will experiment and install `vuepress-plugin-container` plugin
to see if we can renable the Markdown container that used to comes
with default theme.

NOTE: You might need to add/remove custom title to refresh it!
NOTE2: But even with this added, you would still need add custom styling
to make it pretty! The `vuepress-plugin-container` itself does not add
any UI related styling!
