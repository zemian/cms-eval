# Date Test

This post is normal with date prefix in file name.

Notice the URL to access the post is dateparts in path and then the topic name in filename.

## Date url path is wrong?

Link to this post should be: http://localhost:8080/2020/08/07/date-demo/

Why it shows `2020/08/06` but our filename is `2020/08/07` ?

See https://github.com/vuepressjs/vuepress-theme-blog/issues/97

## Home Page Listing

Looks like the home page list posts by recent date. If multiple posts are in same day, it
will list them in descending last modified order.
