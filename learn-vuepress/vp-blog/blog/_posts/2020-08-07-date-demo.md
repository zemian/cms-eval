# Date Test - Normal

This post is normal with date prefix in file name.

Notice the URL to access the post is dateparts in path and then the topic name in filename.

Link to this post is: http://localhost:8080/2020/08/06/date-demo/

TODO: Why it shows `2020/08/06` but our filename is `2020/08/07` ?

## Home Page Listing

Looks like the home page list posts by recent date. If multiple posts are in same day, it
will list them in descending last modified order.
