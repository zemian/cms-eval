# hello-vuepress

> This project is generated using `yarn create vuepress learn-vuepress` with `docs` theme.

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
yarn build
```

For more details, please head VuePress's [documentation](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/).

NOTE: If you run `vuepress dev` in this root directory, it will serve THIS README.md
and not the "docs", which is the main app! Use `yarn dev` instead.
