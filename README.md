A history of many CMS - Content Management System I have used and evaluated.

I have used quite a few CMS for blogging purpose in the past. Some I like,
some not so much.

NOTE: My current blog site is at https://zemian.github.io


## Hisotry of CMS I used

### http://jroller.com/thebugslayer/

One of my earlier blog (I wrote about Scala programming then).


### http://saltnlight5.blogspot.com

I moved the blogging into google Blogger for easy use and looks compare
to jroller.

I stayed with this blogger for few years. Wrote mostly on Java and related programming
topics.

### https://lesscodelessbug.wordpress.com/

I tried little bit of wordpress, but didn't like it much then move back to Blogger.

I did some more WordPress study on a separate repostiroy at https://github.com/zemian/learn-wordpress


### https://github.com/zemian/adocblog

Wrote my own CMS (using Java and Asciidoc)

Hosted in Heruko and my own server.

* Too much work to just maintain CMS for personal use!

### https://medium.com/@zemiandeng

It looks good and easy to use, but it has limit of visists on free users!
This really bugs me.

### https://github.com/zemian/zemian.github.io

This is just a static web site hosted by GitHub (Pages).

I used https://github.com/zemian/zemian.github.io-site and jbake (static site generator) 
to create the blog source, then publish to here.



## CMS Evaluation

### Static Site Generators Evaluation

* Jekyll (ruby) https://jekyllrb.com/ 
	- It's a ruby based generator
	- QuartzScheudler site is using this

* Pelican (python) https://blog.getpelican.com/
	- It's python based, and it's fast and easy to install
	- I like python and thought this would be best for me, but its default look is lacking.

* Hugo (goland) https://gohugo.io/
	- Looks good and has many theme support and it looks good. But I don't know much
	of go programming.

* jbake https://jbake.org/
	- Well java is my bread and butter lang, so I thought I will stick with this. Also
	the asciidoc support is good. So I choose this to make my github pages. 

* VuePress https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/
	- Use Markdown and VueJS to power blog or documentation site.

### Gridsome 

https://gridsome.org

Gridsome makes it easy for developers to build static generated websites & apps that are fast by default 🚀

> Note: This framework is much larger compare to VuePress! It also require more setup.
> Seems to much to setup for simple blog publishing. But might be good to create custom site.

### https://www.netlifycms.org/

A ReactJS based app.

Note: It's a frontend app that interactive with other Site Generator ad data layer!
